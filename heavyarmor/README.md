Armor got so heavy it might slow you down. Gold is uneffected... how unrealistic right? Recommended to use in conjunction with earlyleatherarmor!

If ventilators is installed, ventilators won't be able to push you if your armor is too heavy.

It is **recommended** to disable `Dynamic FOV` in [**Optifine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) if a zooming effect (decreasing FOV) is experienced. **Alternatives:** **Fabric** - [**FovLock**](https://github.com/ChloeDawn/FovLock/releases), **Forge** - [**Custom FoV**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-fov)
