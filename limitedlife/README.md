limitedlife limits the max health of a player by a heart every death. Max health can be restored if a *Batwing* is cooked in a water-filled cauldron under an End Crystal. You can throw an end_crystal item into the cauldron to summon it. The "Absorption" effect will be needed in order to catch the resulting beam!

Also, you can craft a different kind of Elytra using *Batwings* (tip: burns on daylight)!

Recommended to use with graves (*Batwing* will be replaced with *Skull Dust* as the cooking ingredient), ventilators (more uses for *Batwings*) and sapphire (to be able to turn your *Life Support Glass* into *Life Support Sapphire Glass* by holding *Sapphire Glass* in your offhand).
