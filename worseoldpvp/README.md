You want the worse, old PvP back? Worry no more, this datapack will fulfill your wishes! Just drop your tools once onto the ground and enjoy your eZ, no-skill version of PvP!

It is **recommended** to set `Dynamic FOV` to off in **Optifine** if a zooming effect is experienced.

Set *$extend$* in *wop.extend* higher, the more the server is lagging (5 is default): `/scoreboard players set $extend$ wop.extend 6`

Use one of the mode funtions numbered from 0 to 2 if only the sword-block (1) or the no-cooldown (2) is wanted (0 is default): `/function worseoldpvp:mode/0`

Alternatively you can change ones mode individually by changing the palyers *wop.mode* score (0 is default): `/scoreboard players set <player> wop.mode 0`

If you also want to be able to block while not sneaking set *$mustsneak$* in *wop.extend* to 0 (1 is default): `/scoreboard players set $mustsneak$ wop.extend 0`

If you prefer status effects over item attributes set *$attribute$* in *wop.extend* to 0 (1 is default): `/scoreboard players set $attribute$ wop.extend 0`
